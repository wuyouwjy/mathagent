"""Per-node wall-clock ceilings, clamped to the problem deadline.

Previously dead code: nothing called `run_with_timeout`, so `CONFIG["node_timeouts"]`
was decorative and no node had any upper bound. That is why the 2026-07-29 judge run
could spend 1307s on one problem — a node stuck in nested transport retry had nothing
to stop it.

Two layers now cooperate:
  * the ceiling in CONFIG catches a genuine hang in one node;
  * TimeBudget.timeout_for() shortens that ceiling to whatever the 20-minute
    problem deadline still allows, so a late node cannot overrun the whole run.

A cancelled future's thread cannot actually be killed, so a timed-out call keeps
running in the background until its socket timeout fires. That is acceptable here:
the count is bounded by the number of nodes, and the alternative is missing the
platform deadline entirely. What matters is that the *graph* moves on and still
emits an answer.
