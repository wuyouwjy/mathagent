"""Per-problem wall-clock budget — the competition's hard constraint is time, not tokens.

Why this exists (measured 2026-07-29 against intern-s2-preview-397b):

`intern-s2-preview-397b` is a reasoning model. It returns a separate
`reasoning_content` field and BOTH it and `content` are billed against
`max_tokens`. Latency is ~55 completion tokens/s and depends only on tokens
actually generated — `max_tokens` never speeds a call up, it only truncates it
(`finish_reason="length"`, partial CoT leaking into `content`). So token caps
cannot bound a problem's runtime; only a clock can.

The judge run's single failure (Q3 at 1307s vs the 1200s limit) is not explained
by the sum of its stages (~250s measured). The gap is nested transport retry:
`LLMRetryWrapper(max_retries=3)` wrapping a client that itself retries 3× at a
120s socket timeout is up to 9 requests ≈ 1080s from one node. Bounding retries
by count cannot fix that, because the count is split across two layers we do not
jointly control (the platform injects its own client). Bounding them by a
deadline can.

Every LLM call site therefore consults this budget before spending, and optional
stages degrade to deterministic fallbacks once the reserve is reached. The
reserve keeps enough time to always emit a real answer instead of timing out
with nothing.
