"""Shared reconciliation-round policy for validation and retry routing.

A reconciliation round re-runs the whole solving subgraph — another reasoning call
plus another Python call. On this model that is the most expensive action available
(a single reasoning call measured 77-116s on a mid-difficulty problem, and hard
problems run longer), so the round limit is gated by both budgets: tokens, and now
wall clock. Buying a rerun we cannot finish is strictly worse than answering with
what we already have.
