An agent node's retry is only worth buying if the deadline can fund a call that costs
what the last one cost. The failure this prevents (olympiad-level problem, 2026-07-29):
reasoning and Python each ran twice at 510-552s per attempt, the second attempt on each
branch was authorised with ~349s of budget left, and the problem overran its deadline by
198s to finish with no answer at all. Both branches had spent everything and delivered
nothing — the worst possible trade.
